this script will
- convert videos from a folder on the same level or bellow it
- keep the same color range to preserve colors and depth from original file
- use refining parameters to optimize and mantain good bitrate for lowlight or complex scenes
(personally needed for lowlight recordings so the bitrate stays within the specified value)
- read the date metadata from the original file and write on the new file (to preserve the original file date)
- write the converted file in the original path and with the original name with the sufix "_new"

what you can change
- resolution
- bitrate
- frame rate
- audio settings
- etc
